  "description": "# Container With Most Water\n\nYou are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.\n\nFind two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.\n\nReturn the maximum amount of water a container can store.\n\n**Notice** that you may not slant the container.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nInput: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]\nOutput: 49\nExplanation: The vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].\nIn this case, the max area of water the container can contain is 49.\n```\n\n## Constraints\n\n- n == height.length\n- 2 <= n <= 10^5\n- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4",
